            Sett's basic attacks alternate between left and right punch.
            <br>Right punch is slightly stronger and faster.
            <br>Sett also hates losing, gaining additional health regeneration based off of his missing health. 
        </p>

        <h2>KNUCKLE DOWN</h2>
        <p>
            Sett's next two attacks deal additional damage based off of the target's max health.
            <br>Sett also gains Move Speed while moving towards enemy champions.

        <p>
            Sett passively stores damage he takes as Grit.
            <br>On cast, Sett expends all stored Grit to gain a shield and punch an area, dealing true damage in the center and physical damage on the sides.

        <h2>FACEBREAKER</h2>
        <p>
            Sett pulls in all enemies on opposite sides of him, dealing damage and stunning them.
            <br>If enemies were only on one side, they are slowed instead of stunned.
        </p>

        <h2>THE SHOW STOPPER</h2>
        <p>
            Sett carries an enemy champion through the air and slams them into the ground, dealing damage and slowing all enemies near where they land.
