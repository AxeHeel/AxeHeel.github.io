            If Teemo stands still and takes no actions for a short duration, he becomes Invisible indefinitely.
            <br>If he's in brush, Teemo can enter and maintain his Invisibility while moving.
            <br>After leaving Invisibility, Teemo gains the Element of Surprise, increasing his Attack Speed for a few seconds.

        <p>
            Teemo scampers around, passively increasing his Move Speed until he is struck by an enemy champion or turret.
            <br>Teemo can sprint to gain bonus Move Speed that isn't stopped by being struck for a short time.

            Each of Teemo's attacks will poison the target, dealing damage on impact and each second after for 4 seconds.

        <h2>NOXIOUS TRAP</h2>
        <p>
            Teemo throws an explosive poisonous trap using one of the mushrooms stored in his pack.
            <br>If an enemy steps on the trap, it will release a poisonous cloud, slowing enemies and damaging them over time.
            <br>If Teemo throws a mushroom onto another mushroom it will bounce, gaining additional range.
