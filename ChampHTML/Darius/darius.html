        <h2>HEMORRHAGE</h2>
        <p>
            Darius' attacks and damaging abilities cause enemies to bleed for physical damage over 5 seconds, stacking up to 5 times.
            <br>Darius enrages and gains massive Attack Damage when his target reaches max stacks.  
        </p>

        <h2>DECIMATE</h2>
        <p>
            Darius winds up and swings his axe in a wide circle.
            <br>Enemies struck by the blade take more damage than those struck by the handle.
            <br>Darius heals based on enemy champions and large monsters hit by the blade.
        </p>

        <h2>CRIPPLING STRIKE</h2>
        <p>
            Darius's next attack strikes an enemy's crucial artery.
            <br>As they bleed out, their Move Speed is slowed.  
        </p>

        <h2>APPREHEND</h2>
        <p> 
            Darius hones his axe, passively causing his physical damage to ignore a percentage of his target's Armor.
            <br>When activated, Darius sweeps up his enemies with his axe's hook and pulls them to him.
        </p>

        <h2>NOXIAN GUILLOTINE</h2>
        <p>
            Darius leaps to an enemy champion and strikes a lethal blow, dealing true damage.
            <br>This damage is increased for each stack of Hemorrhage on the target.
            <br>If Noxian Guillotine is a killing blow, its cooldown is refreshed for a brief duration.
