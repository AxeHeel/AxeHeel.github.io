        <h2>THE HITMAN AND THE SEER</h2>
        <p>    
            Aphelios wields 5 Lunari Weapons made by his sister Alune.
            <br>He has access to two at a time: one main-hand and one off-hand.
            <br>Each weapon has a unique Basic Attack and Ability.
            <br>Attacks and abilities consume a weapon's ammo.
            <br>When out of ammo, Aphelios discards the weapon and Alune summons the next of the 5.
        </p>

        <h2>WEAPON ABILITES</h2>
        <p>
            Aphelios has 5 different activated abilities, based on his main-hand weapon:
            <br>Calibrum (Rifle): Long range shot that marks its target for a long-range follow-up attack.
            <br>Severum (Scythe Pistol): Run fast while attacking nearby enemies with both weapons.
            <br>Gravitum (Cannon): Root all enemies slowed by this weapon.
            <br>Infernum (Flamethrower): Blast enemies in a cone and attack them with your off-hand weapon.
            <br>Crescendum (Chakram): Deploy a sentry that shoots your off-hand weapon.
        </p>

        <h2>PHASE</h2>
        <p>
            Aphelios swaps his main-hand gun with his off-hand gun, replacing his basic attack and activated ability.

        <h2>WEAPON QUEUE SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>
            Aphelios has no third ability.
            <br>This slot shows the next weapon Alune will give him.
            <br>Weapon order begins fixed but may change over game time -- when a weapon is out of ammo it goes to the end of the order.

        <h2>MOONLIGHT VIGIL</h2>
        <p>
            Fire a concentrated blast of moonlight that explodes on enemy champions.
            <br>Applies the unique effect of Aphelios' main-hand gun.
